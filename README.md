scrape the information on the website to our database and show the information in our website


Site needs to be opened on localhost or any server because of php. 

I scraped the information on the target website using python beautifulsoup4 and request libraries
and stored that information in database using mysql connector in python.

For the website i am using, it is a free template on the internet and i changed that template throughout
my needings. Although it is a free template, it was a raw html so i needed to find how to dynamically add
the data to the website so, i worked for the backend in PHP and redesigned the some of the front-end structures.
functions.php file contains all the necessary functions for fetching information from database.
